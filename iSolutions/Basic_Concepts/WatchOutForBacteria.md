# Exponentiation

### PROBLEM

Did you know that there are more bacteria cells in your body than cells that make up your body? Weird!

A bacteria culture starts with 500 bacteria and doubles in size every hour.
Which means, after 1 hour the number of bacteria is 1000, after 2 hours - 2000, and so on.

#### Task

Let's calculate and output the number of bacteria that will be in the culture after 24 hours.

### CODE

```python
numberOfBacteria = 500 * 2 ** 24

print(numberOfBacteria)
```

### OUTPUT OF THE CODE

#### Sample Output

> 8388608000<br>
